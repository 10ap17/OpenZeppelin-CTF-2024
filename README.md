# OpenZeppelin-CTF-2024
In 2024, OpenZeppelin hosted the highly OpenZeppelin Capture The Flag CTF competition, inspired by their Ethernaut CTF for learning blockchain security. This CTF event aimed to challenge participant's skills in solving blockchain-related challenges within a 48-hour timeframe, encouraging a competitive yet educational environment.

During the competition, participants tackled a series of challenges, each designed to test their understanding of blockchain concepts and security best practices. The ultimate goal was to discover hidden "flags," secret values with the format OZ{some-secret-value-here}, embedded within the challenges. Finding and submitting these flags earned participants points, with the scoreboard reflecting their progress and ranking relative to other participants.

The challenges encompassed a wide range of topics, including smart contract vulnerabilities, Ethereum transaction manipulation, cryptographic puzzles, and more. Participants applied their knowledge of blockchain technology, Ethereum development, and security principles to navigate through these challenges effectively.
